== TODO

Not done (calibration):
* save figures correctly
* record frequency cutoffs with calibration

Not done (benware):
* fix benware to use this latest version of compensation filters, 
  remove absolute level stuff and replace it with level adjustment if
  need be
  -- for makeCalibTone
         loadStimAndCompensate
         astrid's stuff
         makeCSDprobe
         makeBilateralNoise
* update grids (straightforward) -- inc legacyStimLevelOffsetdB
* make benware read in the output of the mic when in a special mode
  -- plot the level of the recorded stimulus
* does benware hash the actual files or just filenames? filenames is fragile
  -- drop caching -- doesn't seem necessary (really?!)


Probably done (check!):
* which way round should the conv be? the filter? IT MATTERS FOR MINPHASE!
* are we losing low frequencies?? testcalib fmsweep suggests so
* check whether something weird is going on with the absolute level --
  an RMS of x should produce a level of y dB, but it doesn't -- 
  compensated and uncompensated golays are different by 10dB ish
* make a sound testing program -- adjust golay player to play arbitrary 
  sound, plot expected and recorded sounds, as well as time-varying
  level in dB (using comp filters to do correction).
  do FM sweep, pure tones, band-limited noise
